The code creates a simple JavaScript calendar that displays the current date in a visually appealing format using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure contains a main container with class "hero," which serves as the background for the calendar. Inside it, there's a <div> element with class "calendar," representing the calendar display. The calendar display is divided into two parts: the left part displaying the date and day of the week, and the right part displaying the month and year.

CSS Styles:
The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the calendar and its components. The "hero" class sets up a full-width and minimum full-height container with a gradient background. The "calendar" class styles the calendar display and centers its content. The "left" class represents the left part of the calendar display, where the date and day of the week are shown in a white box. The "right" class represents the right part of the calendar display, where the month and year are displayed in white over a blue background.

JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript code gets the necessary elements from the HTML using their IDs.
It creates arrays for weekdays and months to map the numeric values from the Date object to their corresponding names.
The current date and time are obtained using the Date object.
The JavaScript code updates the content of each element (date, day, month, year) with the current values obtained from the Date object.
Media Query:
There is a media query for screen widths between 320px and 520px, which adjusts the size and font sizes of the calendar to make it responsive on smaller screens.

Overall, the code creates a simple calendar that displays the current date, day of the week, month, and year. The calendar updates in real-time as the date changes.
